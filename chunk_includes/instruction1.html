<h3>Instruction 1</h3>

<p>
In each trial, you will see a sentence presented on the screen word by word. Most of the words are in black ink, but the last word of the partial sentence is in <font color="red">red</font> ink. Once you see the red word, please produce a <strong>verb</strong> that is a good continuation to the sentence as fast as you can.
