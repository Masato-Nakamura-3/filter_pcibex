<h3>Instruction 2</h3>

<p>
Please make sure to answer just verbs, and nothing else. For example, given "The small yacht", you should avoid saying "swiftly sailed", but just say "sailed".
</p>

<p>
Please try to produce a verb that fits well to the specific context and avoid answering the same verb again and again in different trials.
