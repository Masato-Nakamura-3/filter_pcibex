Thank you so much for participating in our experiment!In this experiment, you will see partial sentences presented on the screen word by word. Please answer aloud a likely continuation for each sentence, and your answer will be recorded.
</p>
  
<p>This experiment requires your FULL ATTENTION. The experiment is reasonably brief, and should take no more than an hour (it is estimated to take about X minutes). During this time, you must give your complete attention. 
</p>
<p>
During the introduction, you will hear audio recordings explaining the experiment. You will progress through the introduction by pressing on your keyboard; you will be able to progress to the next part of the introduction only once the recording for that slide has finished playing.
</p>
<p>
Please move to a quiet environment so that there are no background sounds (e.g. music, television, voices) that will be picked up in the audio recordings. Please also silence computer notifications or use headphones (note that there will be audio during the instructions, so please do not mute your computer).
</p>
<p> When you are ready, please turn off any distractions such as music, television, or a cell phone for the duration of the experiment, and click below to proceed to the detailed instructions. Thank you!
